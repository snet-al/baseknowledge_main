# Python for Beginners

## Jupyter Notebooks

This directory includes **four comprehensive Jupyter notebooks** (`.ipynb` files) that cover Python fundamentals from basics to advanced topics. Each notebook contains examples with **saved outputs**, so you can see the expected results even without running the code.

### Notebook Contents

1. **[Python_Tutorial_1.ipynb](./Python_Tutorial_1.ipynb)**: Python Basics
   - Variables and data types
   - Selection structures (if/else)
   - Repetition structures (for/while loops)
   - Lists and list operations

2. **[Python_Tutorial_2.ipynb](./Python_Tutorial_2.ipynb)**: Functions and Collections
   - Functions (parameters, *args, **kwargs, default values)
   - Lists (advanced operations, slicing, nested lists, list comprehensions)
   - Tuples (creation, accessing, combining with lists)
   - zip() and enumerate() functions

3. **[Python_Tutorial_3.ipynb](./Python_Tutorial_3.ipynb)**: Advanced Data Structures and Concepts
   - Sets (operations, methods, set operations)
   - Dictionaries (creation, accessing, methods, nested dictionaries)
   - File handling (reading, writing, appending)
   - Higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce)
   - Lambda functions
   - Classes and Objects (OOP basics, encapsulation, polymorphism)

4. **[Python_Tutorial_4.ipynb](./Python_Tutorial_4.ipynb)**: Error Handling and Modules
   - Error handling (try-except, else, finally)
   - Raising exceptions
   - Common built-in exceptions
   - Custom exceptions
   - Modules and packages
   - Installing packages with pip

**Note**: When you run the notebooks yourself, you'll get fresh outputs. The saved outputs serve as reference examples.

### How to Use the Notebooks

#### Google Colab (Recommended for Beginners)

**To view and test the notebooks:**
1. Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Click on **File** → **Upload notebook**
3. Select any `.ipynb` file from this directory
4. The notebook will open with all saved outputs visible
5. You can run cells to test the code yourself by clicking the run button
6. Modify the code in any cell to experiment and learn

#### Locally using PyCharm
##### [PyCharm Community Edition](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)

PyCharm is a powerful IDE specifically designed for Python development.

###### Running Jupyter Notebooks in PyCharm
1. Install Jupyter: `pip install jupyter`
2. Open a `.ipynb` file in PyCharm
3. PyCharm will automatically detect it and allow you to run the code
