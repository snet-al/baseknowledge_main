# Python to AI/LLM Roadmap
This module is a structured learning path for beginners to go from Python fundamentals to building AI models and interacting with local LLMs.

## Roadmap

1. **Python Basics**: Learn syntax, control flow, functions, data structures and other important basic concepts of python.
2. **Data Libraries**: Master Pydantic, Pandas and NumPy.
3. **AI Agents**: Run local LLMs using Ollama and orchestrate with LangGraph.
4. **Deep Learning Frameworks**: Get hands-on with TensorFlow and PyTorch.
5. **ML & AI Theory**: Understand supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, and hybrid methods. Learn classical and deep learning models.

## How to navigate

This module is organized into three main directories:

- **[Python for beginners](./Python%20for%20beginners/)**: Contains materials and resources to learn Python fundamentals.

- **[Python AI Libraries](./Python%20AI%20Libraries/)**: Contains resources to learn AI libraries in Python for building and using AI applications, including data libraries (Pydantic, Pandas, NumPy), AI agents (Ollama, LangGraph), and deep learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch).

- **[Literature](./Literature/)**: Contains materials and sources to learn about AI/ML theory and basics that are necessary for understanding machine learning and artificial intelligence concepts.
