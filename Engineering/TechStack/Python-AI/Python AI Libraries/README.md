### 4. **Ollama** - Local LLM Runtime

Ollama allows you to run large language models (LLMs) locally on your machine. It's perfect for AI applications that need to work offline or with privacy concerns.

**What you'll learn:**
- Installing and running Ollama
- Pulling and managing LLM models
- Using the Ollama API
- Running models locally
- Integrating with Python applications

**Start here**: Check out the [Ollama documentation](https://ollama.ai/docs) for installation and usage guides.

### 5. **LangGraph** - AI Agent Orchestration

LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It helps you create complex AI agents that can handle multi-step reasoning and workflows.

**What you'll learn:**
- Building stateful AI agents
- Creating multi-step workflows
- Agent orchestration patterns
- Integrating with LLMs
- Building complex AI applications
- State management and memory
- Human-in-the-loop workflows
- Deployment strategies

**Start here**: 
- Take the free [LangChain Academy course](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph) for a structured learning path 
- Reference the [LangGraph documentation](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) for detailed API information
- Explore the [agent-service-toolkit](https://github.com/JoshuaC215/agent-service-toolkit) for a complete production example using LangGraph, FastAPI, and Streamlit. This repository shows how to:
  - Set up LangGraph agents (including with Ollama support)
  - Build a FastAPI service for agent deployment
  - Create a Streamlit chat interface
  - Implement streaming, memory, and human-in-the-loop features
  - Deploy agents with Docker
