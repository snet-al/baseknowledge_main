# Pandas Tutorial

This directory contains a comprehensive Jupyter notebook for learning **Pandas** - Python's powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.

## About the Notebook

**[Python_Tutorial_Pandas.ipynb](./Python_Tutorial_Pandas.ipynb)** is a complete tutorial covering:

### 1. **Creating Pandas DataFrame**
   - Creating DataFrame from lists of lists
   - Creating DataFrame using dictionaries
   - Creating DataFrame from files (CSV files from local drive, Google Drive, and URLs)

### 2. **Pandas DataFrame Standard Operations**
   - DataFrame general description and information
   - Creating sub-DataFrames by selections
   - Filtering DataFrames
   - Using aggregate methods (mean, sum, min, max, etc.)
   - Data normalization for machine learning

### 3. **Practical Tasks**
   - Task 1: Student grades analysis (mean, median calculations)
   - Task 2: Row selection operations
   - Task 3: Filtering students above average
   - Task 4: Calculating grade percentages
   - Task 5: Loading and working with the Iris dataset

## Dataset Files

The following dataset files are provided in this directory for practice:

- **`iris.csv`**: Classic Iris flower dataset (commonly used in machine learning)
- **`taxes 4.csv`**: Tax-related dataset for practice
- **`taxes2.csv`**: Additional tax dataset
- **`taxes3.csv`**: Another tax dataset variant

These files are used throughout the notebook examples. You can use them to practice the concepts covered in the tutorial by uploading the notebook and the files in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

## Next Steps
