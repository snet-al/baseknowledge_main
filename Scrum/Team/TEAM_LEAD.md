# ROLE_SPECIFICATION: Technical Team Leader (TTL)

## 1. Role Overview

The Technical Team Leader (TTL) is the single point of accountability for a specific technology team, or as will be defined and Vertical Team in the matrix of management. This is a "Heavyweight" leadership role that combines **People Management**, **Technical Management**

**Core Mission:** To build a high-performing team of engineers while ensuring the software they build is scalable, modern, and aligned with the company’s technical vision.

## 2. Technical Leadership & Strategy

- **Technology Selection:** Evaluate and define the tech stack, frameworks, and third-party tools. You ensure the stack is fit-for-purpose and future-proof.
- **Architectural Ownership:** Lead the design of complex systems and microservices. You hold the final decision-making power (DRI) on technical disputes. This responsibility is added by default to the TTL, but if the projects become larger, the role of TECH LEAD emerges per project.
- **Standards & Quality:** Enforce "Clean Code" principles, automated testing strategies, and robust CI/CD pipelines.
- **Technical Debt Management:** Balance the trade-off between shipping features quickly and maintaining a healthy, refactored codebase.

## 3. People Management & Growth (The Mentor)

- **Career Development:** Conduct weekly 1-on-1s(or defined by TL). You are responsible for the performance reviews, salary adjustments, and promotion paths of your team.
- **Defining the Learning Path:** You are responsible for the team’s "Skill Matrix." You identify skill gaps and define the curriculum for engineers to learn new technologies (e.g., Cloud Native patterns, new languages, or AI integration).
- **Technical Coaching:** Actively mentor engineers through pair programming and architectural whiteboarding sessions.
- **Culture of Excellence:** Foster an environment of psychological safety where the best technical idea wins, regardless of seniority.

---

## 4. Execution & Delivery (The Driver)

- **Product Partnership:** Collaborate with the Product Manager to turn business requirements into technical execution plans.
- **Agile Governance:** Own the team's internal process (Scrum/Kanban). Facilitate sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives.
- **Blocker Removal:** Proactively identify and clear technical or organizational bottlenecks that slow the team down.
- **Incident Leadership:** Serve as the primary escalation point for production issues, ensuring rapid resolution and post-mortem analysis.

## 5. The "Learning Path" Framework

As the TTL, you are the "Dean" of your team's technical education. You are expected to:

1.  **Audit:** Map the current technical strengths and weaknesses of every engineer.
2.  **Roadmap:** Create a 6-month learning roadmap for the team (e.g., "Transitioning from Monolith to Microservices").
3.  **Implement:** Dedicate a specific percentage of sprint capacity (e.g., 10%) to R&D and skill acquisition.

## 6. Success Metrics (KPIs)

| Metric                      | Target                                               |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| **System Reliability**      | Uptime, Error Rates, and Latency benchmarks.         |
| **Team Growth**             | Successful completion of "Learning Path" milestones. |
| **Delivery Predictability** | Percentage of committed sprint tasks completed.      |
| **Retention**               | Voluntary turnover rate and team engagement scores.  |

## 7. Role Boundaries

- **Not a Soloist:** Your success is measured by the team's output, not your individual lines of code.
- **Not a Micromanager:** Define the _standards_ and the _destination_, but trust your engineers to choose the _route_.
- **The "Pivot":** You must balance the Product Manager’s desire for **features** with the Engineering Department's desire for **stability**.
