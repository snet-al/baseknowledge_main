## Definition Of DONE

Every Product Backlog item has acceptance criteria that define measurably what must be met when the item is declared to be done.<br>
Many criteria apply to all or many Product Backlog items. Instead of repeatedly defining these criteria with each item, it has proven to be useful to collect these criteria in one place: the Definition of Done.<br> Thus, the Definition of Done is a shared understanding of the Scrum Team on the meaning of work to be complete. It typically contains quality criteria, constraints and overall non-functional requirements. Here is some examples:

> - Reviewed by at least three participants

1.  Team leader about functional part
2.  Specialized review about coding standarts
3.  Another team member

> - Completed unit tests

> - Completed QA tests

> - Completed documentation
