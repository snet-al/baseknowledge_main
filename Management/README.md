# 📑 Standardized Project Initiation Framework

## 1. Centralized Knowledge Base

* **Resource Location**: Store all templates, guides, and references in a centralized repository (Google Drive main folder or internal Wiki).
* **Access**: All team members have read access, edit rights restricted.
* **Version Control**: Ensure consistency with version control (GitHub repo for templates).

## 2. Ownership and Responsibilities

| Phase                                                  | Responsibility                                                                                                              | Key Role(s)                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Phase 0: Client Requirements Intake & Folder Setup** | Receive requirements from client, create dedicated project folder, upload all received docs                                 | **Project Manager (PM)**          |
| **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & CE Preparation**    | Delegate to Tech Lead / CTO / Team Leads → breakdown project into smallest tasks (Excel chart); enable Cost Estimation (CE) | **PM + Tech Lead/CTO/Team Leads** |
| **Phase 2: Agreement with Client**                     | Draft Project Initiation Document (PID), review with client                                                                 | **PM**                            |
| **Phase 3: Project Initiation**                        | Setup ClickUp, draft Project Plan, validate setup                                                                           | **Scrum Master / PO + Team Lead** |
| **Phase 4: Project Development**                       | Backlog creation & task writing; share with client for approval                                                             | **Scrum Master / PO + Team Lead** |
| **Phase 5: Retrospective**                             | Collect feedback & improvements                                                                                             | **PM + Team**                     |

## 3. Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

### 🔹 **Phase 0: Requirements Intake (New)**

**Steps**:

1. PM receives **Requirements Document (RD)** from the client.
2. PM creates a **dedicated folder** in **SNET Projects Drive**.
3. All client-provided documents are uploaded to this folder.

**Deliverable**: Organized project folder with all client docs.
**Quality Check**: PM confirms completeness.

---

### 🔹 **Phase 1: Requirements Analysis & Cost Estimation (CE)**

**Steps**:

1. PM delegates the requirement analysis to **Tech Lead / CTO / Team Leads**.
2. Tech Lead breaks project into **smallest evaluable tasks** (granularity based on company’s standard chart of task units).
3. An **Excel Project Breakdown** is created → includes tasks, effort estimates, dependencies.
4. PM consolidates into **Cost Estimation (CE)** for client.

**Checklist**:

* [ ] Each requirement mapped to at least one task.
* [ ] Each task is atomic (smallest evaluable unit).
* [ ] Task effort aligns with internal **evaluation chart**.

**Deliverable**: Excel Breakdown + CE Draft.
**Quality Check**: PM + Tech Lead joint validation.

---

### 🔹 **Phase 2: Agreement with Client**

* **Steps**:

  * Draft **Project Initiation Document (PID)** using CE and TOR as baseline.
  * Include pre-planning, scope, general estimation.
  * Review iteratively with client.

* **Deliverable**: Signed PID.

* **Quality Check**: PM + Client approval.

---

### 🔹 **Phase 3: Project Initiation**

* Setup ClickUp (assign members, workflow).
* Draft **Project Plan** in Excel (templates).
* Validate with Team Lead.

**Deliverable**: Approved Project Plan.
**Quality Check**: Team Lead review.

---

### 🔹 **Phase 4: Project Development (Backlog & Execution)**

* Create backlog in ClickUp based on Project Plan.
* Write tasks using Scrum Task Template.
* Share backlog with client for approval.

**Deliverable**: Approved backlog.
**Quality Check**: Scrum Master + PO validation.

---

### 🔹 **Phase 5: Retrospective**

* Run retrospective session after project completion.
* Collect client + team feedback.
* Document lessons learned in Knowledge Base.

**Deliverable**: Retrospective Report.
**Quality Check**: PM approval.

---

## 4. Supporting Elements

* **Validation Checkpoints**:

  * Phase 0 → Folder completeness.
  * Phase 1 → CE validated by PM + Tech Lead.
  * Phase 2 → PID client sign-off.
  * Phase 3 → Project Plan validation.
  * Phase 4 → Client approval of backlog.
  * Phase 5 → Retrospective recorded.

* **Risk Management**:

  * Risks identified during CE (Phase 1) and PID (Phase 2).
  * Mitigation strategies logged in PID.

* **Automation & Tools**:

  * **SNET Projects Drive** → Docs repository.
  * **Excel** → Breakdown & CE.
  * **ClickUp** → Project & backlog tracking.
  * **GitHub** → Version control of templates.

⚡ With this update:

* **PM is always the first entry point**.
* **CE cannot exist without a structured breakdown**.
* **Company-wide task unit chart ensures consistency** across all estimates.
